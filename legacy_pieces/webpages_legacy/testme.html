                        <P class="projectText">This is my narrative design website. I used several languages (MySQL,
                            JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AJAX, Node.js) to build this site. The point of the project was to
                            tell a story using real data. I thought it would be a lot of fun to research people who have
                            attempted to conquer the world. The problem I ran into was how do you define a world
                            conqueror? I created 10 different categories that I researched in order to compare famous
                            people throughout history. Some of these people were known as conquerors, some of these
                            people were from my own curiosity, and others were really famous names that I felt would add
                            to the data. It was a fun project to create not only a website, but a visual depiction of a
                            very vague term in history. The story it ended up telling about history and famous world
                            leaders was incredible. This was one of my all time favorite projects.</P>
